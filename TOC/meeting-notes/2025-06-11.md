## Minutes

- [Tekton Pipeline upgrade](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/8683)
  - We will default await-sidecar-readiness to false to speed up start of pipelines
  - jx-updatebot har been changed so that the option `--auto-merge` will be ignored for `jx updatebot env` when there is a release note. This is to prevent upgrades that need manual steps from being applied automatically.
  - What is left if upgrading to the latest tekton pipeline version: 1.1.0
  - The upgrades of different components are gathered in one PR: https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx3-versions/pull/4138
- Change project name [CDF doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O6Ai29X-ojCgX8OfWM6PP6PelIWFmU47eeNmhdu8lpA/edit?tab=t.0)
