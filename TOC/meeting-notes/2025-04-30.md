## Minutes

- [Tekton Pipeline upgrade](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/8683)
  - Jordan has successfully upgraded Tekton Pipeline in his organisation. Before we can upgrade in
    the version stream there are a few more components that need upgrading; most notably
    jx-pipelines and jx-build-controller.
- Change project name [CDF doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O6Ai29X-ojCgX8OfWM6PP6PelIWFmU47eeNmhdu8lpA/edit?tab=t.0)
  - We decided to go with jx as the new name and jx project as longer form of the name, when
    needed. The exact capitalisation will be decided in cooperation with a designer of a new
    logotype.
  - Jordan will contact designer
  - Mårten will contact CDF
  - Mårten will contact admin of Kubernetes slack about changing the names of the slack channels.
