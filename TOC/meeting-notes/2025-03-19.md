# Jenkins X Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) meeting March 19th 2025

## Participants

- Mårten Svantesson
- Jordan Goasdoué

## Minutes

- Change project name
    - We didn't come to any conclusion regarding the name
    - Jordan will work on the name change. He also know of a designer on fiverr that he can recommend
    - Mårten will check with CDF how expensing to CDF for the logo will work in practice
    - We at least want the Tekton Pipelines upgrade done before the name change is announced. Maybe
      other changes as well.
- [Tekton Pipeline upgrade](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/8683)
    - Jordan has prepared PRs for [lighthouse](https://github.com/jenkins-x/lighthouse/pull/1621) and [tekton-helm-chart](https://github.com/cdfoundation/tekton-helm-chart/pull/68)
    - The tekton-helm-chart PR can be merged first so a helm chart to test is created
    - The pr pipeline for lighthouse publishes a helm chart that can be tested
    - Mårten will help with this testing
    - Testing will be done with the existing toolchain: At least Jenkins X dashboard, jx pipeline
      and jx gitops
    - When the lighthouse PR is is merged the resulting PR for jx3-versions will be updated manually
      with the corresponding version of tekton-helm-chart. If testing has shown that othere
      components needs to be updated joint those will be updated and tested in that PR as well.
